    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In this matzo brei (rhymes with fry) recipe, the matzo sheets are browned in butter until crisp before being lightly scrambled with eggs. It's a fine breakfast or brunch any time of the year, and especially during Passover.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><strong>For the Matzo Brei</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 sheets matzo</li>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten with 1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>Large pinch salt, more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>To make it savory</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Large pinch black pepper</li>
        <li>Chopped chives, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>To make it sweet</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon Demerrara sugar, more to taste</li>
        <li>Honey or maple syrup, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Under cool running water, rinse matzo sheets until they are quite wet. Set it aside and let sit to soften while you prepare the pan.</li>
        <li>Place a large, preferably nonstick skillet over medium-high heat and add butter. Once it melts and the foam subsides, break matzo sheets into bite-size pieces and add to pan. Sauté matzo in butter until it browns all over, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add eggs, salt and pepper (if you’re making the dish savory) to pan and scramble the mixture until it is just set but still light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with sugar (if you’re making it sweet) and toss well.</li>
        <li>Serve matzo brei sprinkled with salt and topped with chives (savory), or with salt, additional sugar and maple syrup (sweet).</li>
    </ol>
